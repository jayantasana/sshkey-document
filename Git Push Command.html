Generating a new SSH key

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

<! --- $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" --->

<! ---Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:--->

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

<! ---This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.--->

> Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.

3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

> Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519):[Press enter any name]

4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type your password]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type your password again]

<! ---Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:--->

<! ---# start the ssh-agent in the background--->
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
<! --- Agent pid 59566--->


<! ---Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.--->

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
or 
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

copy command code: clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
